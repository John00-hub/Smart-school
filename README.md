# SmartSchool — School Management Portal

Role-based school management portal with four dashboards (Administrator,
Teacher, Parent, Student). React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS, backed by
Supabase (Postgres, Auth, Row Level Security).

**→ Full setup, security model and known limits: [SETUP.md](SETUP.md)**

---

## Quick start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev          # http://localhost:5173
```

Runs immediately in **demo mode** on a bundled dataset — no credentials
needed. Add Supabase keys to switch to a live database (see SETUP.md §2).

### Demo logins

| Role | Email | Password |
|---|---|---|
| Administrator | `admin@smartschool.edu` | `Admin123!` |
| Teacher | `teacher@smartschool.edu` | `Teacher123!` |
| Parent | `parent@smartschool.edu` | `Parent123!` |
| Student | `student@smartschool.edu` | `Student123!` |

## Features

- **Landing page** — hero, features, role overview, footer
- **Auth** — email/password, persistent sessions, password reset, role-based
  redirect, protected routes
- **Admin** — dashboard stats, student CRUD + search/filter, teacher directory,
  class management with enrolment capacity, announcements
- **Teacher** — assigned classes only, student lists, results entry
  (CA 30 + Exam 70 with live grade preview), daily attendance marking
- **Parent** — switch between multiple children, results, attendance,
  performance summary
- **Student** — results, attendance, weekly timetable, announcements, GPA
- **UI** — responsive from phone to desktop, collapsible sidebar, mobile
  drawer, toasts, confirmation dialogs, empty states, loading states

## Scripts

```bash
npm run dev         # dev server
npm run build       # typecheck + production bundle
npm run preview     # serve the build
npm test            # 46 assertions over the real store/grading/auth modules
npm run check:sql   # parse schema.sql + seed.sql with the PostgreSQL parser,
                    # verify RLS coverage and policy drop/create pairing
```

`npm test` bundles the actual TypeScript source with esbuild and runs it under
jsdom — it exercises the shipped modules, not a reimplementation.

`npm run check:sql` uses `libpg-query` (the real PostgreSQL 18 parser compiled
to WASM) to parse every statement *and* every function body with its true
signature, then asserts no RLS-enabled table was left without a policy.

## Security summary

Role is never client-controlled: the signup trigger always assigns `student`,
a before-update trigger blocks self-escalation, 41 RLS policies filter every
row per role, and privileged operations run through `SECURITY DEFINER` RPCs
that re-check `is_admin()`. Duplicate results and double-marked attendance are
rejected by unique constraints in Postgres. Details in SETUP.md §4.

The `service_role` key is not used anywhere in this project and must never be
added to the frontend.
